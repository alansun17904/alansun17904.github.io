## About Me
I am a second-year MSCS student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and a recipient of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).  

Before CMU, I was a visiting scholar at the [Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Mariya Toneva](https://mtoneva.com/). I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) with highest honors. At Dartmouth,
I conducted research with [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where I worked to create
a mathematical framework that enables the characterization of robustness of language models. My honors thesis, *Acheiving Domain-Independent Certified
Robustness via Knowledge Continuity*, was awarded [First Prize for Oustanding Research in Computational Sciences](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/research/neukom-research-prizes/2024-research-prize-winners) by the Neukom Institute as well as the [John G. Kemeny Computing Prize for Innovation](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/prizes-funding-opportunities/kemeny-prize/previous-winners).

## Research

I am interested in exploring the duality between the generality of deep networks and their interpretability.
