## About Me
This fall I will matriculate as an MSCS student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the [Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Mariya Toneva](https://mtoneva.com/). I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) with high honors. At Dartmouth,
I conducted research with [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where I worked to create
mathematical frameworks that enable the characterization of robustness of language models. My honors thesis, *Acheiving Domain-Independent Certified
Robustness via Knowledge Continuity*, was awarded [First Prize for Oustanding Research in Computational Sciences](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/research/neukom-research-prizes/2024-research-prize-winners) by the Neukom Institute as well as the [John G. Kemeny Computing Prize for Innovation](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/john-g-kemeny-computing-prize).

My current research focuses on interpreting the mechanisms of artificial neural networks through circuit discovery. 

## Research
I am interested in improving the robustness of deep learning models by proving tight certifications and discovering novel adversarial examples.
I am also interested in uncovering the mechanisms that enable their decision making. Through explorations of both these subfields, I wish
to expose the opaque links between them.
