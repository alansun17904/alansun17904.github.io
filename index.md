## About Me
I am a first-year MSCS student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

This past summer, I was a visiting scholar at the [Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Mariya Toneva](https://mtoneva.com/). I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) with highest honors. At Dartmouth,
I conducted research with [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where I worked to create
a mathematical framework that enables the characterization of robustness of language models. My honors thesis, *Acheiving Domain-Independent Certified
Robustness via Knowledge Continuity*, was awarded [First Prize for Oustanding Research in Computational Sciences](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/research/neukom-research-prizes/2024-research-prize-winners) by the Neukom Institute as well as the [John G. Kemeny Computing Prize for Innovation](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/john-g-kemeny-computing-prize).

My current research focuses on interpreting the mechanisms of artificial neural networks through circuit discovery. 

## Research
I am interested in improving the robustness and interpretability of deep learning models by uncovering
the mechanisms underlying their decision-making processes and developing frameworks to enhance their stability.
My research explores how models reason and adapt across tasks, introducing concepts like *knowledge continuity*
and *circuit stability* to provide a unified understanding of robustness. By bridging gaps between theory
and practice, I aim to expose the opaque links between adversarial vulnerabilities, interpretability challenges
like superposition, and the structural properties of neural representations,
enabling safer and more reliable AI systems.
