## About Me
This fall I will matriculate as an MSCS student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the [Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://mpi-sws.org/) advised by [Mariya Toneva](https://mtoneva.com/). I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/). At Dartmouth,
I conducted research with [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) where I worked to create
mathematical frameworks that enable the characterization of robustness of language models.

My current research focuses on interpreting the mechanisms of artificial neural networks through circuit discovery. 

## Research
I am interested in improving the robustness of deep learning models by proving tight certifications and discovering novel adversarial examples.
I am also interested in uncovering the mechanisms that enable their decision making. Through explorations of both these subfields, I wish
to expose the opaque links between them.
